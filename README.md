# ICON Blockchain Smart Contracts Tips
A collection of tutorials, tips, problem-solving and discussion on Icon Smart Contracts (SCOREs).

## Goal
When building on the Icon Blockchain it can be challenging to get help in solving issues you run into. You can either try and get some one to answer your questions in the Icon Discord or the Icon Dev Telegram. This is not ideal.

With this repo, I hope to create a way for all involved in the ICON project to have a database of tips and solutions to problems one can run into when writing Smart Contracts on the Icon Blockchain.

It would be great if ICON developers can do small write ups on specific subjects or tips. You never know what might save some friendly dev a lot of time, so any subject and format goes.

## How to use: searching for topics / tips
Try and search a topic within this repo using the Github search (top left) and choose 'in this repository'.

## How to use: adding write ups
In the `/write_ups` folder, you can do a pull request to add tips/whatever.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
